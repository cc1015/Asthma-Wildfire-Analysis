This is an analysis of California wildfires and ashthma-related emergency department visits. We found a correlation between the overall increase of wildfires in California over time and
the increase in asthmatic issues present in the California population over time. While correlation does not always indicate causation, and there could be other plausible causes of the increase in asthmatic issues in the population, air pollution from wildfires is
definitely a valid cause as well. Second, according to the analysis conducted in Figure 2 and 4, it is difficult to find a strong correlation between the high occurrence of asthma incidences in certain counties and attribute them to the 
large amount of acreage burned by wildfires in specific counties. However this doesn’t necessarily
disprove the conclusions we made in figure 3, as additional variables could’ve played a role in there not
being a high correlation within counties as mentioned in the analysis. Additionally, certain counties did
show an increase in emergency department visit rates related to asthma that also had a high amount of
acreage burnt during wildfires, so some correlation is present, it is just not a strong one.
Overall, this research produced both interesting and important findings as it shows the negative
impact California wildfires have had on the health of its citizens. Wildfires and other climate change
events have already begun affecting the health of citizens, which is further made clear by the research
conducted in this project. It is a very real and prevalent issue of today that requires serious attention by
public health officials and policymakers so that the dangerous risk on the lives of citizens and our
environment can be mitigated.
